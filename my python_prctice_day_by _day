answers above quesations for me practice learning 

✅ 1. What is type casting? Give an example.
Answer:
Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another manually in Python.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
a = "123"
b = int(a)   # '123' (string) → 123 (integer)
print(b + 10)  # Output: 133
✅ 2. Convert the following:
a. "123" to integer:

python
Copy
Edit
x = int("123")  # Output: 123
b. 25 to string:

python
Copy
Edit
x = str(25)     # Output: "25"
c. "3.14" to float:

python
Copy
Edit
x = float("3.14")  # Output: 3.14
✅ 3. What error occurs if you try int("abc")? Why? Correct it.
Answer:

python
Copy
Edit
int("abc")  # ❌ ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
Why?
Because "abc" is not a number.

✅ Correct usage:

python
Copy
Edit
# Valid number string:
x = int("123")  # Output: 123
✅ 4. How do you create a multi-line string in Python?
Answer:
Use triple quotes (''' or """).

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
text = '''This is
a multi-line
string.'''
print(text)
✅ 5. How do you include a quote inside a string?
Answer:
Use escape characters (\) or alternate quote styles.

Examples:

python
Copy
Edit
text = "She said, \"Hello!\""
# or
text = 'She said, "Hello!"'
print(text)
✅ 6. Convert price = "99.99" to a float:
python
Copy
Edit
price = "99.99"
price_float = float(price)
print(price_float)  # Output: 99.99
✅ 7. Create a string: I'm learning "Python" using escape characters:
python
Copy
Edit
text = "I'm learning \"Python\""
print(text)
✅ 8. What is a raw string? What is its use?
Answer:
A raw string treats backslashes (\) as literal characters, not escape characters.

Use: It's helpful when working with file paths or regex patterns.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
path = r"C:\Users\Ashok\Documents"
print(path)
# Output: C:\Users\Ashok\Documents
Without raw string:

python
Copy
Edit
path = "C:\\Users\\Ashok\\Documents"









second prcatice learning python day 2  probealms sloving in git hub?

practice questions:
1.Question: Write a Python program that takes a string as input and prints its length.
Example Input: "Hello World"
Expected Output: The length of the string is: 11

2.Question: Given the string data = "abcdefghijklmnop", write Python code to:
A. Get the first 5 characters.
B. Get the last 3 characters.
C. Get characters from index 2 to 7 (inclusive of 2, exclusive of 8).
D. Get every second character.
E. Reverse the string.

3.Question: If you have a string sentence = "This is a long sentence.", how would you extract the word "long" using slicing?

4.Question: Write a Python program that takes a string as input and prints each character of the string on a new line using a for loop.

5.Question: Modify the program in question 4 to also print the index of each character alongside the character.

6.Question: You have the variables product = "Laptop" and price = 60,000. Use an f-string to print the following sentence: "The Laptop costs 60,000."

7.Question: Given the variables name = "vikas" and score = 85, use an f-string to print: "vikas's score is 85."

8.Question: Using the .format() method, create the same output as in Question 6: "The Laptop costs 60,000."

9.Question: Write a Python program that takes a string as input and uses the enumerate() function to print each character along with its index.

10.Question: Write a Python program that takes a string as input and uses the range() function along with a for loop to print each character of the string in reverse order of their index.




above answers lerning my practice?

text = input("Enter a string: ")
print("The length of the string is:", len(text))
# Example input: Hello World → Output: 11
✅ 2. String Slicing
python
Copy
Edit
data = "abcdefghijklmnop"

# A. First 5 characters
print("First 5:", data[:5])  # Output: abcde

# B. Last 3 characters
print("Last 3:", data[-3:])  # Output: nop

# C. Characters from index 2 to 7
print("Index 2 to 7:", data[2:8])  # Output: cdefgh

# D. Every second character
print("Every second:", data[::2])  # Output: acegikmo

# E. Reverse the string
print("Reversed:", data[::-1])  # Output: ponmlkjihgfedcba
✅ 3. Extract "long" using slicing
python
Copy
Edit
sentence = "This is a long sentence."
word = sentence[10:14]
print("Extracted word:", word)  # Output: long
✅ 4. Print each character on a new line
python
Copy
Edit
text = input("Enter a string: ")
for char in text:
    print(char)
✅ 5. Print each character with index
python
Copy
Edit
text = input("Enter a string: ")
for index, char in enumerate(text):
