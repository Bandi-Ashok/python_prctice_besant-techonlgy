answers above quesations for me practice learning 

‚úÖ 1. What is type casting? Give an example.
Answer:
Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another manually in Python.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
a = "123"
b = int(a)   # '123' (string) ‚Üí 123 (integer)
print(b + 10)  # Output: 133
‚úÖ 2. Convert the following:
a. "123" to integer:

python
Copy
Edit
x = int("123")  # Output: 123
b. 25 to string:

python
Copy
Edit
x = str(25)     # Output: "25"
c. "3.14" to float:

python
Copy
Edit
x = float("3.14")  # Output: 3.14
‚úÖ 3. What error occurs if you try int("abc")? Why? Correct it.
Answer:

python
Copy
Edit
int("abc")  # ‚ùå ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
Why?
Because "abc" is not a number.

‚úÖ Correct usage:

python
Copy
Edit
# Valid number string:
x = int("123")  # Output: 123
‚úÖ 4. How do you create a multi-line string in Python?
Answer:
Use triple quotes (''' or """).

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
text = '''This is
a multi-line
string.'''
print(text)
‚úÖ 5. How do you include a quote inside a string?
Answer:
Use escape characters (\) or alternate quote styles.

Examples:

python
Copy
Edit
text = "She said, \"Hello!\""
# or
text = 'She said, "Hello!"'
print(text)
‚úÖ 6. Convert price = "99.99" to a float:
python
Copy
Edit
price = "99.99"
price_float = float(price)
print(price_float)  # Output: 99.99
‚úÖ 7. Create a string: I'm learning "Python" using escape characters:
python
Copy
Edit
text = "I'm learning \"Python\""
print(text)
‚úÖ 8. What is a raw string? What is its use?
Answer:
A raw string treats backslashes (\) as literal characters, not escape characters.

Use: It's helpful when working with file paths or regex patterns.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
path = r"C:\Users\Ashok\Documents"
print(path)
# Output: C:\Users\Ashok\Documents
Without raw string:

python
Copy
Edit
path = "C:\\Users\\Ashok\\Documents"

answers that above quesatioms for me?


1. What is a for loop in Python, and when would you typically use it?
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, tuple, dictionary, or a range). You use it when you know in advance how many times you want to run a block of code.

‚úÖ Example:

python
Copy
Edit
for i in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(i)


2. Explain the syntax of a basic for loop in Python.
python
Copy
Edit
for variable in iterable:
    # block of code
for fruit in ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]:
    print(fruit)


3. What is an iterable? Give a few examples of built-in iterables in Python that are commonly used with for loops.
An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time.
üìå Examples of built-in iterables:

Strings

Lists

Tuples

Dictionaries

Ranges

‚úÖ Example:

python
Copy
Edit
for char in "hello":  # string is iterable
    print(char)

4. How can you iterate through the characters of a string using a for loop?
‚úÖ Example:

python
Copy
Edit
text = "Python"
for char in text:
    print(char)



5. What is the purpose of the range() function when used with a for loop? Give a simple example.
The range() function generates a sequence of numbers. It‚Äôs commonly used to repeat actions a specific number of times in a for loop.

‚úÖ Example:

python
Copy
Edit
for i in range(5):  # 0 to 4
    print(i)


6. Can you have a for loop inside another for loop? If so, what is this called?
Yes, it‚Äôs called a nested loop.

‚úÖ Example:

python
Copy
Edit
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")

7. What is a while loop in Python, and when would you typically use it?
A while loop runs as long as a condition is True. Use it when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

‚úÖ Example:

python
Copy
Edit
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1


8. Explain the syntax of a basic while loop in Python. What is the condition?
python
Copy
Edit
while condition:
    # block of code
The loop runs as long as the condition is True.

‚úÖ Example:

python
Copy
Edit
x = 5
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1




9. What is an infinite loop? How can you accidentally create one with a while loop, and how can you prevent it?
An infinite loop runs forever unless stopped.
This can happen if the condition never becomes False.

‚ùå Example of accidental infinite loop:

python
Copy
Edit
x = 1
while x > 0:  # This will never end unless x decreases
    print(x)
‚úÖ Prevention: Always update the condition inside the loop:

python
Copy
Edit
x = 5
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1



10. How do the break and continue statements work within a while loop?
break: exits the loop completely.

continue: skips the rest of the current iteration and goes to the next loop condition.

‚úÖ Example with break:

python
Copy
Edit
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1
‚úÖ Example with continue:

python
Copy
Edit
i = 0
while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
